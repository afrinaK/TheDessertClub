                    Hello &amp; Chaò, we, a group of enthusiast youngsters came up with the idea of our own online dessert platform. Welcome to our world of sweetness. All of us love food very much and especially dessert. We are best friends and co-workers in society life. We feel inseparable as we work, live and spend time together. We didn’t take our selves too seriously when we started this back then and still, kinda, sorta take ourselves more seriously now. We’re currently studying at Bangladesh University of Professional and also very busy cooks too.

                    We love to travel together and explore different new places, food and culture. That’s how we get to taste different flavors of different cultures. We are also cooking lovers and eventually discovered ourselves recreating some of the remarkable desserts of the home and abroad. That’s when our journey at The Dessert Club began. In our free time, we share recipes and stories on our blog, which is our happy little creative space. Our food blog here is a small slice of life that allows us to get away from our busy university life to just escape and connect with wonderful friends around the world. It’s our delicious creative outlet. Fueled by our love of local culture, people &amp; rich heritage, we document powerful stories from around the world.

Our page here is a small slice of life that allows us to get away from our busy university schedule to just escape and connect with wonderful people around the world. It’s our delicious creative outlet. Fueled by our love of local culture, people &amp; rich heritage, we document powerful stories from around the world. Whether on working in an assignment, we feel so lucky to be doing what we love. We believe in celebrating kind people, good food, great conversation, green gardening and traveling. Our lives have always been about love, family, friends, and sharing. Connecting with people through food, sharing stories and supporting one another to live our dreams is what inspires us to work for it. Memories from our childhoods inspire us to cook, consume, and create what you see here on our personal blog. Although our perception and outlook are vastly different, we know that what we have in common far outweigh our differences. This site is our outlet to share our love of food, cooking, travel, adventure and friendship. </p>
